# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    Creat an app building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JS. Wrote HTML & CSS to match a provided comp. Created an app that allows users to write their own message and save it into the array of either affirmations, mantras or both. Created functions, querySelectors and eventListeners; in addition to learning CSS and mimicking a design for the self-care project. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?) 
    Git flow: Forked the project. Went into terminal to go to directory of choice. Git clone SSH link. CD into the directoy that was cloned. Code .. to open up VS code. Saved and commited work by doing git add . and git commit-m and git push. Also created new branches and merged all branches to main. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
    In assets.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
    I read this project on Monday and asked questions about it on Tuesday. I started working on the project starting Tuesday and spent about a couple hours on it Tuesday, Wednesday. On Thursday after the mid-mods, I spent a lot more time on it and also spent more time on it Friday & Satuday. I spent around 17-20h on the project and I am in Mod 1, third week in. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
    Solo Project

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
    Learning goals was how to use HTML, CSS and JS together. I was able to use flexbox and utilize that into my project. I learned how to better utilize class and id and learned how to better incorporate functions, querySelectors to grab elements and use eventListeners to execute. I learned how important it was to plan out the project first before working on MVP. I should have read MVP and created an outline of it on paper, drew it out and then outlined the CYOA and drew it out as well so I could have a better naming system. My naming system wasn't great, I wasn't very organized at first because I was struggling to get started and was having a hard time figuring out what my next steps were.Since I wasn't as organized as I would liked to be, I had to go back and fix areas of code I had completed. I also need to keep track of when I crate branches and when I commit and push because after a break or after working on it another day, I would forget what I had done before and didn't know where to start. I had a merge conflict and didn't know what to do. I did watch the video but I ended up working more on the project without commiting and pushing until I met with Will and he helped me fix my issues. Therefore, there was a part that I wasn't commiting and pushing as much. I learned how important it is to be organized. It makes my life easier and I need to name my "ids" and and functions better so that it doesn't get confusing. I thought I was getting better at naming but clearly, I wasn't because I confused myself a lot.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
    I was able to get the submit message to work. I was able to seperate the radio buttons and affirmation and mantra text from each other. I faced a lot of challenges and had a hard time figuring out the functions. I think the querySelectors were a lot easier to complete this time around; however, the functions are still giving me a difficult time but I think I am getting better with conditionals. Since I plan to review this project again and compare it to my ROMCOM project for more learning. I had trouble moving around the affimation and mantra text in the receive message and submit message boxes, but I did more research and played around with the CSS and eventually, it worked. It was a lot of trial and error, sleeping on it and figuring it out two days after trying it out the first time. Overall, this was a very fun project and I learned a lot.
