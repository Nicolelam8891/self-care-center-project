# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    Creat an app building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JS. 
    Wrote HTML & CSS to match a provided comp. 
    Created an app that allows users to write their own message and save it into the array of either affirmations, mantras or both. 
    Created functions, querySelectors and eventListeners; in addition to learning CSS and mimicking a design for the self-care project. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?) 
    Git flow: Forked the project. Went into terminal to go to the directory of choice. Git clone SSH link. CD into the directory that was cloned. Code .. to open up VS code. Saved and committed work by doing git add . and git commit-m and git push. Also created new branches and merged all branches to the main branch.  

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
    In assets.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
    I read this project on Monday and asked questions about it on Tuesday. I spent around 17-20h on the project and I am in Mod 1, third week in. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
    Solo Project

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
    Learning goals was how to use HTML, CSS and JS together. I was able to use flexbox and utilize that into my project. 
    I learned how to better utilize class and id and learned how to better incorporate functions, querySelectors to grab elements and use eventListeners to execute. 
    I learned how important it was to plan out the project first before working on MVP. 
    I learned how important it is to be organized throughout the project. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
    WIN: I was able to get the submit message to work. 
    I was able to separate the radio buttons and affirmation and mantra text from each other. 
    Improved my understanding of functions
    Able to get the MVP section to work and also a choose your own adventure. 
    CHALLENGE: I faced a lot of challenges and had a hard time figuring out the functions. 
    I think the querySelectors were a lot easier to complete this time around; however, the functions are still giving me a difficult time but I think I am getting better with conditionals. 
    I had trouble moving around the affirmation and mantra text in the received message and submit message boxes. There was a lot of trial and error. 
    Overall, this was a very fun project and I learned a lot.
